          I believe in writing clean, ethical code that provides users of all
          backgrounds an aesthetically pleasing, accessible experience.
          Serving the needs of others, as best as I can, is what drives me to code. I
          also greatly enjoy picking up new technologies to improve my workflow and
          unlock new skills. My experience teaching music production and English have
          helped me develop an eye for debuggingâ€” from grading papers, based on syntax
          and formatting, to teaching music students multiple ways to solve the same issue
          in their music production software.
